A link element creates a relationship to another page or resource. This is how we tell the site which css to use, link to other pages, or connect to resources for the page.  
The div tag is a wrapper and makes a new line. It is commonly used as a container to hold html elements, then styled with CSS. 
In CSS, id's are keyed to  with #idname, while classes are keyed to with .classname.  
Padding affects the space in an element block, moving content away from the edges and changing size.  
Margin affects the space outside element block, between it and other elements.  
The flex argument makes a flexbox for the element. The element canthen be aligned vertically, justified horizontally, flexed in the horizontal (row) or vertical (column) direction. flex-wrap allows an image to wrap to new lines if the container becomes small. Flex-shrink and flex-basis affect how much space a container takes up relative to the other elements in the container. By default, the syntax for flex is flex: <flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>.  
Units: pixels (px), points (pt), inches (in), centimeters (cm), percent of parent (%), width of parent font m (em), width of root font m (rem), height of element font (ex), percentage of viewport width (vw), percentage of viewport height (vh), percentage of viewport smaller dimension (vmin), percentage of viewports larger dimension (vmax).
